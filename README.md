# 🐍 My Python Learning Journey

This repository contains all the code I wrote while learning Python — from the very basics to mini-projects, Jupyter notebooks, and trying out new libraries.

## 📂 Folder Structure

Here's a breakdown of what's inside:

- `100 Days Task/` – Daily learning challenges and practice tasks
- `Basics/` – My very first Python codes when I was just starting out
- `Chat GPT Codes/` – Snippets and solutions I got from ChatGPT while exploring
- `Jupy/` – Python practice in Jupyter Notebooks (`.ipynb` format)
- `Matplotlib/` – Visualizations and experiments with the `matplotlib` library
- `Others/` – Random ideas, tests, or miscellaneous code
- `Practice/` – General-purpose Python practice
- `Project/` – Small, beginner-level projects
- `PySpark/` – Playing around with PySpark for big data processing
- `PyTorch/` – Some basic deep learning experiments with PyTorch

## 🤹‍♂️ A Quick Note

Some of the code here might look silly, irrelevant, or random — and that's totally fine with me! 😄  
I wrote a lot of these either for fun, out of curiosity, or just to test what would happen if I tried something strange.  
So if something looks broken or confusing, it might be me learning by doing... or just goofing around.

## 📚 Why This Repo Exists

This repo shows my journey of learning Python.  
I eventually stopped writing basic examples once I got the hang of it — but I'm still learning every day.  
I created this to:
- Track my learning progress
- Share what I’ve done with others
- Receive feedback to keep improving
